Challenge problem:
I faced lots of challenges building this calculator, but my challenge problem was the currency calculator. I had to find a way to calculate 
different currencies converted to different currencies. I didnt want to have 25 different methods for 25 different combinations of currencies
So in the end I thought of my solution. I first asked the user what is the currenct currency, converted it to CAD and from there, 
i converted it to the desired currency.
