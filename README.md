Challenge problem: I faced lots of challenges building this calculator, but my challenge problem was the currency calculator.
I had to find a way to calculate different currencies converted to different currencies. I didnt want to have 25 different methods
for 25 different combinations of currencies So in the end I thought of my solution. I first asked the user what is the currenct currency, 
converted it to CAD and from there, i converted it to the desired currency.
